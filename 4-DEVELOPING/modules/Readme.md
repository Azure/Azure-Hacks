# Developing Microservices in Azure

## Introduction

The Azure hack is intended to teach how to host, operate, and run microservices on Azure. During this hack you will be working in Container Apps, CosmosDB, Eventhub, Load Tests and Application Insights.


## Learning Objectives

1. Build technical skills for deploying, operating, and monitoring workloads in Azure
2. Understand different Azure Services that can be employed in a microservices architecture.

## Challenges

- Challenge 1: **[Pre-requisites - Ready, Set, GO!](modules/module-1/readme.md)**
  - A smart cloud solution architect always has the right tools in their toolbox. 
- Challenge 2: **[First Thing First -  Overview - Build the apps ](modules/module-2/readme.md)**

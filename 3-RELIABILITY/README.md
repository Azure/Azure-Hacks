# Hack - Reliability on Azure

Welcome to the "**Reliability on Azure**" hack! 
This challenge series will guide you through 3 of the design principals to build reliable applications on Azure. We will start with some basic services in Azure and work our way through each one of the following desing principals:
- Design for **Resiliency**
- Design for **Recovery**
- Design for **Operations**

Reliability has to be measured from the customer's perspective, not the component perspective.

## Hack Introduction

This series of challenges explores how to build a reliable architecture in Azure, learn how to monitor the system and how to deal with failures. It is designed to provide a comprehensive, hands-on experience in implementing reliability design principles on Azure. Through these challenges, you will explore how reliable your workload is, how to improve it, and how to observe and trace your reliabilty.

## General Prerequisites

Before proceeding, please ensure you have completed the necessary setup as described in the [Setup](../1-SETUP/README.md).

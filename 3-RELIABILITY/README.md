# Day 4: Azure Reliability Hackathon + Wrap-Up

## Welcome to Day 4! ðŸ”„

Our final day focuses on reliability engineering and operational excellence. You'll deploy redundant web applications, implement comprehensive monitoring, and simulate failures using Azure Chaos Studio. This capstone experience brings together all concepts from the previous three days, culminating in a wrap-up session reflecting on your Azure journey.

## Day 4 Schedule (8.5 hours total)

**Morning & Afternoon Sessions (8 hours)**
- Deploy redundant web applications with high availability
- Implement VM backup strategies and monitoring solutions  
- Configure incident alerts and automated responses
- Simulate real-world failures using Azure Chaos Studio

**Final Session (30 minutes)**
- **Closing & Wrap-Up**: Final reflections, key takeaways, and next steps

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 4, you will:
- âœ… Implement high availability and disaster recovery patterns
- âœ… Deploy redundant applications across Azure regions
- âœ… Configure comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- âœ… Use Azure Chaos Studio for resilience testing
- âœ… Apply operational excellence principles
- âœ… Integrate learnings from Security, Architecture, and Development days

## Reliability Challenge Overview

Welcome to the "**Reliability on Azure**" hack! 

This final challenge series integrates security (Day 1), architecture (Day 2), and development (Day 3) principles while focusing on three core reliability design principles:
- Design for **Resiliency**
- Design for **Recovery**
- Design for **Operations**

Reliability has to be measured from the customer's perspective, not the component perspective.

## Hack Introduction

This series of challenges explores how to build a reliable architecture in Azure, learn how to monitor the system and how to deal with failures. It is designed to provide a comprehensive, hands-on experience in implementing reliability design principles on Azure. Through these challenges, you will explore how reliable your workload is, how to improve it, and how to observe and trace your reliabilty.

## General Prerequisites

Before proceeding, please ensure you have completed the necessary setup as described in the [Setup](../1-SETUP/README.md).

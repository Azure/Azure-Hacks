# Module 3: Application Security
## Securing Applications with Identity-Based Access

### Overview
Application security in Azure focuses on controlling how applications authenticate and access resources. This module covers Service Principals, Managed Identities, and application-level security controls like IP restrictions and firewall rules.

### Learning Objectives  
By completing this module, you will:
- Create and configure Service Principals for application authentication
- Understand the difference between Service Principals and Managed Identities
- Assign appropriate RBAC permissions to applications
- Implement App Service firewall and IP restriction controls
- Secure application endpoints from unauthorized access

### Prerequisites
- Completion of Module 1 (Identity & Access Management)
- Basic understanding of application authentication concepts
- Azure CLI access and permissions to create Service Principals

---

## Hands-On Tasks

### Task 1: Create and Configure a Service Principal
**Goal**: Set up a Service Principal for secure application authentication

**What you'll do**: Create a Service Principal with password-based authentication and assign it appropriate permissions for accessing Azure resources.

**Success Criteria**: 
- Service Principal successfully created
- Password credentials generated and secured
- Able to authenticate using Service Principal credentials
- Understand when to use Service Principals vs Managed Identities

<br>

1. **Sign in to the Azure Portal**
   - Go to: [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - **Note:** Use an account with the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription you are using for this lab.

2.  #### Using Azure CLI
Execute the following command to create a service principle:

```sh
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name myServicePrincipalCloudAcademy --role reader --scopes /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myRG1 
```

**Example:**

```sh
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name myServicePrincipalCloudAcademy --role reader --scopes /subscriptions/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/resourceGroups/Security-TESTs
```
</details>

### Result
ðŸŽŠ **Congratulations!** You have successfully created a service principle.

### Task 2: Assign RBAC Permissions to Service Principals
**Goal**: Configure role-based access control for your Service Principal

**What you'll do**: Create and manage role assignments to restrict or grant access to specific Azure resources and resource groups.

**Success Criteria**: 
- Service Principal assigned appropriate role (Reader, Contributor, or custom role)
- Permissions tested and validated
- Understanding of different Azure roles and their capabilities
- Able to create and remove role assignments as needed 

ðŸ’¡ **Hint**: The Reader role is more restrictive with read-only access. Always use the principle of least privilege. For a complete list of available roles in Azure RBAC, see [Azure built-in roles]( https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).

1. **Sign in to the Azure Portal**
   - Go to: [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - **Note:** Use an account with the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription you are using for this lab.

2. **Using Azure CLI**
Execute the following command to assign Contributor permissions to Your previously service principle:

```sh
az role assignment delete--assignee myServicePrincipalID --role Reader --scope /subscriptions/mySubscriptionID/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupName

az role assignment create --assignee myServicePrincipalID --role Contributor --scope /subscriptions/mySubscriptionID/resourceGroups/myResourceGroupName
```

**Example:**

```sh

az role assignment delete --assignee d8XXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXX07a --role Reader --scope /subscriptions/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/resourceGroups/Security-TESTs

az role assignment create --assignee d8XXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXX07a --role Contributor --scope / subscriptions/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/resourceGroups/Security-TESTs
```

**Please put your credentials into example!**

### Result
ðŸŽŠ **Congratulations!** You have successfully  assigned a Contributor permissions to Your previously service principle.

ðŸ’¡ **Hint**: Follow the step-by-step guide above to ensure proper role assignment.

###  Task 3: Create a resource using a service principal
- **Instructions:** If given the necessary permissions, a service principal can create and manage Azure resources just like an account. This tutorial step provides an example of how to create a resource for Azure Storage using a service principal
- **Success Criteria:** Azure storage account created with the proper permissions.

ðŸ’¡ **Hint**: The Storage account will be used in other tasks [Azure Storage]( https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/).

1. **Sign in to the Azure Portal**
   - Go to: [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - **Note:** Use an account with the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription you are using for this lab.

2. **Using Azure CLI**
To sign in with a service principal, you need to reuse credentials with which  you created a service principal in Task 1.

```sh

az login --service-principal -u <app-id> -p <password-or-cert> --tenant <tenant>

```

**Example:**

```sh

az login --service-principal -u d8XXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXX07a -p XXXXXXXXxXXXXxXXXXxXXXXxXXXXXXXXXx --tenant XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX

```

3. **  Create a storage account**

```sh

az storage account create --name myStorageAccountName --resource-group myResourceGroupName --kind <KIND> --sku Standard_LRS --location westus

```

**Example:**

```sh
az storage account create --name mystorageaccountca --resource-group Security-TESTs --kind StorageV2 --sku Standard_LRS --location southafricanorth

```

4. **  Get resource keys to authenticate to the Azure storage account.**

```sh

az storage account keys list --resource-group myResourceGroupName --account-name myStorageAccountName

```

**Example:**

```sh

az storage account keys list --resource-group Security-TESTs  --account-name mystorageaccountca

```


</details>

### Result
ðŸŽŠ **Congratulations!** You have successfully created Azure storage account.
